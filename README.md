## Title: Exploring the World of Geospatial Data Science

## Speaker: Professor Song Gao, Department of Geography, Faculty Affiliates of Data Science Institute, UW-Madison

## Abstract: Geospatial data about the Earth environment and society are captured by millions of environmental and human sensors in a variety of formats such as remote sensing imageries, crowdsourced maps, geotagged videos and photos, transportation smart card transactions, mobile phone data, social media content, and GPS trajectories. In this mini-workshop/presentation, I will share the popular geospatial data formats and general workflow for collecting, processing, analyzing, and visualizing geospatial datasets using open-source Python packages.
